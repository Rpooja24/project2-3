    <h4>What is Climate Change? Impacts in Nepal.</h4>
<p>Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be 
natural, such as through variations in the solar cycle. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the 
main driver of climate change, primarily due to burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.<br>
 Nepal is a 
least developed country, with 28.6 percent of the population living in multidimensional poverty. Analysis of 
trends from 1971 to 2014 by the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM) shows that the average 
annual maximum temperature has been increasing by 0.056 Â°C per year. Precipitation extremes are found to 
be increasing. Data reveals that more than 80 percent of property loss due to disasters is attributable to 
climate hazards, particularly water-related events such as floods, landslides, and glacial lake outburst floods 
(GLOFs).<br>Floods spread across the foothills of the Himalayas and bring landslides, leaving tens of thousands of houses 
and vast areas of farmland and roads destroyed. In the 2020 edition of Germanwatch's Climate Risk Index, it 
    was judged to be the ninth hardest-hit nation by climate calamities during the period 1999 to 2018.</p><h4>So, Nepal is at high risk of climate change impacts due to vulnerability in both physical and economical conditions.</h4>
